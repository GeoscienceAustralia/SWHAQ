Severe Wind Hazard Assessment for Queensland

The Severe Wind Hazard Assessment for Queensland (SWHA(Q)) project aims to to provide realistic and tangible data on the potential physical impacts of severe tropical cyclones on Queensland communities to enable the emergency management sector and local government to more effectively engage with the community. The data and information will also assist with the understanding of the potential impacts from climate change and inform strategic risk treatment strategies.  

The project is a collaboration between Geoscience Australia and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), with additional support from Department of Environment and Science Queensland (DES). 

This repository holds scripts and configuration files used in the modelling and analysis components of the project. References are made to other code bases maintained by Geoscience Australia - e.g. `TCRM <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm>`_ and `HazImp <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/hazimp>`_.
